# ASCII-Art-Generator
Drawing program written in C++ that generates ASCII art after user inputted commands. 
Implemented using a linked-list grid structure where user input guides the pen based on certain commands. 
Achieved by parsing and storing user commands for pen direction and length then manipulating linked-list grid to reflect updated changes.
